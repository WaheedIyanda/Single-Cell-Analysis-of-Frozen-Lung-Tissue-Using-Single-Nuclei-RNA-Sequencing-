# Single-Cell-Analysis-of-Frozen-Lung-Tissue-Using-Single-Nuclei-RNA-Sequencing-
The human lung is a highly complex organ composed of diverse cell types that perform essential functions in respiration and homeostasis. Understanding the cellular composition and transcriptional landscape of normal lung tissue is critical for establishing a baseline reference for lung biology and for comparing pathological states in future studies. This project employs single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to analyze gene expression at the single-cell level in frozen normal lung tissue, allowing for an in-depth characterization of cell-type-specific transcriptomic profiles.
The analysis pipeline follows standard computational workflows, beginning with quality control (QC) to filter low-quality nuclei and remove technical artifacts. Normalization and clustering were performed to classify distinct cellular populations. Marker gene analysis was used to annotate different lung cell types, followed by the identification of highly variable genes to capture the most dynamic transcriptional features of normal lung cells. Further, differential expression (DE) analysis was conducted to assess variability across cell types, and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment was applied to determine the biological functions associated with these gene sets. Finally, pathway enrichment and network analysis were used to explore functional interactions between key regulatory genes.
